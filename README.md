# Multivariable_rs485
##rs485_project.pdf details the project on multivariable parameter interfacing using RS485


This is an analysis project that details analysis and implementation of the following protocols.
  RS 232 (UART), I2C, SPI-Serial Peripheral Interface,CAN-Control Area Network protocol and RS 485 advanced version of RS 232.
  
Based on the practical implementation analysis the report explains as to which protocol is a better scenaron in a particular scenario.

However for long distance communication between MCU's, CAN and RS485 give optimum performance.
